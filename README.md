**Intro_to_Java_Programming_Comprehensive_Version_Exercises**
**What this program does:**
This is a file with all the exercises that i've made so far and it will be upgraded as i make more. Before I did them all in 1 file and different packages i made a repository for each. Sadly I deleted some of those repositories when i was cleaning up and before i got the idea for this, so some of the exercies that i've made isnt in this file.
All programs in this file work and the packages are named after chapters and packages for the specific exercise aswell, so classes to each exercise got it's own package.
